(In the woods. The Woodcutter is cutting woods. He is working hard.)

Woodcutter: Oh, no, the ax went off the handle. There is a pond, and it's falling into it. What am I going to do? I can't work without my ax. What will my poor family eat?

(He sits down by the pond and cries. The Water God comes out of the pond.)

Water God: Who are you?
Woodcutter: I am the poor Woodcutter.
Water God: Why are you crying so sadly?
Woodcutter: Because my ax fell into the pond. I can󰡑t work without it. My poor family will be hungry. 
Water God: Wait! I'll find it for you.
Woodcutter: Thank you, sir.

(The Water God goes into the pond, and comes out again. He has a
gold ax in his hand.)

Water God: Is this your ax?
Woodcutter: No, sir. Mine is an old one.

(The Water God goes in again. This time he comes out with a silver ax.)

Water God: Then is this yours?
Woodcutter: No, sir. That is not mine. 

(The Water God goes in, and comes out with the Woodcutter's old ax.)

Water God: What about this one?
Woodcutter: Thank you, sir. That is mine. I am so happy. 
Water God: You are a good man. I know you are telling the truth. For that, I will give you the gold ax and the silver ax, too. Take them.
Woodcutter: Thank you very much. You are very kind.

(The Water God goes back into the pond.)

Friend: Where did you get them? Are you really gold and silver?
